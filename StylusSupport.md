# Introduction #

Basically, there are three options for using Quill:

  1. An active stylus. This requires special hardware in your tablet, but is by far the best choice for writing. Such a special pen only works with one particular tablet.
  1. A capacitive pen. For the tablet, this is indistinguishable from finger touches. But at least you can hold a pen in your hand! There is a wide variety of different manufacturers, and they work with every tablet.
  1. Draw with your fingers. Clearly this is not very precise nor the way we naturally write...

N-trig http://www.n-trig.com is a company that sells a particular hardware solution that is used in a few Android tablets. The active stylus is actually interchangeable between the different N-trig based tablets.

Likewise, the Samsung S-pen is interchangeable with certain Wacom pens.

# Capacitive Pen #

If there is no special hardware in your tablet to sense an active pen, you can always use a capacitive pen. They can be recognized by their rounded tip, as in this photo:

They are often sold as if they were made for a particular device (for Ipad, for Asus Transformer, for ...) but they are all interchangeable and not tied to a particular tablet. In my limited experience all capacitive pens work about equally well, so I don't have a particular favorite. If you found one that works particularly well for you then please leave a comment!



## Motorola XYboard (Xoom 2) Stylus ##

I still don't know what this one is. It certainly is **not** a n-trig stylus. It doesn't seem to be able to distinguish pen input from finger touches. My guess is that it is based on the Atmel maxtouch chipset series, http://www.atmel.com/microsite/maxtouch_eseries/. If you have any information please let me know!
