Development platform is a ThinkPad tablet. Other tablets might work, but I can't test them all myself. If you try it on a different tablet, please write about your experience!

## Tablets With Active Pens ##

This is the best hardware choice for taking notes. The dedicated hardware in the tablet can distinguish the [active pen](StylusSupport.md) from finger touches, and can sense pen pressure.

  * ThinkPad tablet: Developer's tablet, works (and is awesome)
  * HTC Flyer upgraded to Honeycomb: Active pen detection works.
  * HTC Flyer still running Gingerbread can't run Quill, sorry.
  * HTC Jetstream: Active pen detection works.
  * Xoom xyboard 10.1: Stylus input isn't different from touch input, it seems. Nice tablet, but not good for writing notes.
  * Samsung Galaxy Note with ICS (Tested with RocketRom v1.5): Works great!
  * Samsung Galaxy Note running Gingerbread can't run Quill, sorry.



## Tablets Without Active Pen Hardware ##

While not perfect, you can write reasonably well with a [capacitive pen](StylusSupport.md) on these. Disadvantages are that the pen is indistinguishable from finger touches (hence gestures must be disabled) and pressure is not recorded.

  * Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1" not really usable by default, but using the [Touchscreen Tune app](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.vital) from the market leads to a marked improvement. Make sure to enable the palm rejection in Touchscreen Tune.
  * Asus Transformer
  * Asus Transformer Prime: this tablet is also supported by the [Touchscreen Tune app](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.vital). Make sure to enable the palm rejection in Touchscreen Tune.
  * Acer Iconia A500
  * Toshiba Thrive
  * Original Xoom
  * Xoom xyboard 8.9"
  * Sony Tablet S: Not usable, only intermittent points are captured instead of complete pen strokes.
